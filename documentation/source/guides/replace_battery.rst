For this operation, only a PZ1 screw driver is needed as all screw are M3

The very first step is to protect the screen, as it is very easy to scratch it
while opening VerTIGo. For this purpose, use the screen cutout ant tape it on
the four side.

.. caution::

   The gluing of the screen is the most difficult operation whilea
   building VerTIGo, and therefore it is the most difficult part to replace.
